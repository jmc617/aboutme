      <h2 class="h2">A little about me:</h2>
        <p>I grew up in West Philadelphia. I attended PennState University in State College, PA. I majored in Communication Disorders (a fancy term for speech and hearing therapy) and Psychology. I then worked as an assistant teacher at a school for children with cerebral palsy. Next, I attended Drexel University part time and earned my Master's in Elementary and Special Education. I moved to Tampa, Florida and began teaching my own classroom. While I always enjoyed working with kids, I couldn't deny the fact that what I enjoyed most was using technology, being creative and making things. I loved programming communication devices for students so that they were able to explore meaningful communication. I was lucky enough to come across information about the field of web development. It sounded perfect to me and it wouldn't require another degree! I decided to begin learning code to see if it was really the career path that was meant for me. I began doing phone tech support for iOS devices while studying code in my free time. Once it was clear that I enjoyed the coding process, I researched bootcamp options and chose NYCDA where I am currently participating in their web development intensive.

      <h2 class="h2">The Future</h2>
        <p>My goal is to find a company that knows how to not only nurture, but challenge junior developers. I'd love to work with projects related to education, but as long as I get to build things I will be happy. I also love to learn and am excited to continue learning as much as I can in my field</p>
